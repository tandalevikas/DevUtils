As consumers become more familiar with purchasing alcoholic beverages online, platforms such as Amazon, Total Wine, and specialized spirit retailers are playing an integral role in facilitating these transactions. Moreover, the ability to offer subscription services and targeted promotions online presents new opportunities for building brand loyalty.
