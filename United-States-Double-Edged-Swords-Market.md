In this segment, swords are often crafted to withstand combat scenarios, with high-quality materials such as stainless steel or carbon steel being common choices for blades, and hilt designs that prioritize ergonomics and grip stability. <p>In addition to their historical significance, modern-day military enthusiasts and tactical training schools also keep the demand for such weapons alive.
